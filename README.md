# Study-pyephem

This document presents some capabilities of the [PyEphem](http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/) library. As an example I consider **How long is a day?** The document was written in [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) so anyone can insert own geographic localization and recalculate the day length. Particularly this file is recommended for students.

## Requirements

The document was prepared using *Python 2.7* and the following packages:

 * *ephem 3.7.6.0*
 * *pandas 0.20.3*
 * *matplotlib 2.0.2*
